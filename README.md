# Rooftop Solar Potential Estimation

An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for **automated rooftop segmentation** and **solar potential estimation** from high-resolution aerial imagery.  

Uses HRNet + OCR with boundary-aware modules to produce accurate rooftop masks, estimate usable area, and compute annual energy generation with PVGIS data.
