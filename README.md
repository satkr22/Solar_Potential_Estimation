# Rooftop Solar Potential Estimation

An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for **automated rooftop segmentation** and **solar potential estimation** from high-resolution aerial imagery.  

This project presents a deep learning-based pipeline for rooftop solar potential estimation using high-resolution satellite imagery. It combines HRNet with OCR and boundary-aware modules for accurate rooftop segmentation, followed by post-processing and integration with PVGIS to estimate usable rooftop area and annual solar energy yield. The framework is trained in two stages—using the RID dataset for generic feature learning and a custom Indian dataset for local adaptation—supporting city-scale analysis for sustainable urban planning.
